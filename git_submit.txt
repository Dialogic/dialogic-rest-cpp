Just a note on how to push a change to github.
HTTPS push isn't used. Rather ssh push with public/private key is used.

git commit -m "Message for commit" files...
git remote show origin
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:Dialogic/dialogic-rest-cpp.git
git remote show origin
git push
